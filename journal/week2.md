cd terratowns_mock_server/
rm -rf .git

chmod u+x bin/terratowns/*

## Working with Ruby

### Bundler

Bundler is a package manager for ruby.
It is the primary way to install ruby packages (known as 'gems') for ruby.

#### Install Gems

You need to create a Gemfile and define your gems in that file.
Rubygems is the website where the gems are hosted, its a special package / repo

```rb
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'sinatra'
gem 'rake'
gem 'pry'
gem 'puma'
gem 'activerecord'
```

Then you need to run the `bundle install` command

This will install the gems on the system globally (unlike nodejs which install packages in place in a folder called node_modules)

A Gemfile.lock will be created to lock down the gem versions used in this project.

#### Executing ruby scripts in the context of bundler

We have to use `bundle exec` to tell future ruby scripts to use the gems we installed. This is the way to set context.

### Sinatra

Sinatra is a micro web-framework for ruby to build web-apps.

Its great for mock or development servers or for very simple projects.

You can create a web-server in a single file.

## Terratowns Mock Server

### Running the web server

We can run the web server by executing the following commands:

```rb
bundle install
bundle exec ruby server.rb
```

All of the code for our server is stored in the `server.rb` file.

./bin/terratowns/create

## CRUD

Terraform Provider resources utilize CRUD.

CRUD stands for Create, Read Update, and Delete
*Create can be Post / Put

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete

Build first 
./bin/build_provider

then tf init

Change Terraform cloud credentials.
To keep the app safe it is better to generate credentials ie an API token
that expires.
Once generated, save it in the file:
```open /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json```
